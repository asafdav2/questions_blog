**Question**: Givan two real numbers $$x$$ and $$\epsilon$$, find the square root of $$x$$ within error margin of $$\epsilon$$ 
(in other words, find $$y$$ such that $$ \lvert \sqrt{x} - y \rvert < \epsilon$$). Obviously, you're not allowed to use the standard ```sqrt``` function. 

Please try to solve the question on your own. If you want, you can check out my solution [here](/blog/2014/11/29/square-root-(solution)).
