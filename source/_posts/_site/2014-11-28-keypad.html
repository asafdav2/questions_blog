<p><strong>Question</strong>: Given the English alphabet, ‘a’ through ‘z’ (lowercase), and an imaginary onscreen keyboard with the letters laid out in 6 rows and 5 columns:</p>

<pre><code>a b c d e
f g h i j
k l m n o
p q r s t
u v w x y
z
</code></pre>

<p>write a function that given a word will produce the sequence of key presses required to type out the word on the onscreen keyboard. The function should return the sequence string (up - ‘u’, down - ‘d’, left - ‘l’, right - ‘r’ and enter - ‘!’).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: We build the solution in steps. We start with movements between two characters. To do it, we can find the x/y coordinates of both characters
and then recursively diminish the x and y differences. To adapt the solution for full word we should split the word to a list of character pairs (for example, convert “hello” to [(‘h’, ‘e’), (‘e’, ‘l’), (‘l’, ‘l’), (‘l’, ‘o’)]). 
Two more required changes are to prepend ‘a’ to the word (to start movemonts from the top left corner of the keypad) and insert ‘!’ whenever we reached a character of the word.</p>

<p>The following is a Scala solution:</p>

<p>``` Scala
class Keypad {</p>

<p>val rowLength = 5</p>

<p>def movements(from: (Int, Int), to: (Int, Int)): List[String] = if (from == to) Nil else {
    val xDiff = to._1 - from._1
    val yDiff = to._2 - from._2
    if (xDiff &lt; 0) 
      “l” :: movements(left(from), to)
    else if (yDiff &gt; 0)
      “d” :: movements(down(from), to)
    else if (yDiff &lt; 0)
      “u” :: movements(up(from), to)
    else 
      “r” :: movements(right(from), to)
  }</p>

<p>def movements(from: Char, to: Char): List[String] = movements(coords(from), coords(to))</p>

<p>def movements(pairs: List[(Char, Char)]): List[String] = if (pairs.isEmpty) Nil else 
    movements(pairs.head._1, pairs.head._2) ::: List(“!”) ::: movements(pairs.tail)</p>

<p>def movements(word: String): List[String] = { 
    val chars = ‘a’ :: word.toList
    val pairs = chars zip chars.tail
    movements(pairs)
  }</p>

<p>def coords(c: Char): (Int, Int) = {
    val i = c - ‘a’
    (i % rowLength, i / rowLength)
  }</p>

<p>def down(p: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = (p._1, p._2 + 1)
  def up(p: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = (p._1, p._2 - 1)
  def right(p: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = (p._1 + 1, p._2)
  def left(p: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = (p._1 - 1, p._2)
}
```</p>
